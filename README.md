# Smash Bros. Ultimate Random Character Selector
## Features
- Selects between 1 and 5 random characters, with the ability to give characters weights to make them more or less likely to appear, or just use a regular random with no weighting
- Disable and enable all 86 fighters, or enable alternate characters such as Alph, the Koopalings, seperate Pyra & Mythra, etc.
- Increase the weight of a character (making them less likely to appear in future selections) in the weighted random by selecting them
- Ability to edit weights of all characters manually in the options
- Saving of weights and enabled/disabled characters, so you do not need to enter all information each time you launch

### About this project
I made this tool as I personally wanted a weighted random character selector to use in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and thought it was a good opportunity to practice using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5, as well as being something I could put up as a portfolio piece.
